## Pre-Validation: Party Mode Session

**Agents involved:** John (PM), Mary (Analyst), Sally (UX), Winston (Architect), Bob (SM)

6 findings identified and **all fixed** in the PRD before formal validation:

| # | Finding | Severity | Fix Applied |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | FR24 — shortlist sharing behavior undefined (snapshot vs. live, read-only vs. collaborative) | 🔴 Must Fix | ✅ Added "read-only snapshot at time of generation" + recipient behavior |
| 2 | FR17-FR21 (Community Pages) not in Journey Requirements Summary — orphan requirements | 🔴 Must Fix | ✅ Added community pages row with Maria, Hans mapping |
| 3 | FR22-FR28 (Shortlist system) not in Journey Requirements Summary | 🔴 Must Fix | ✅ Added shortlist + smart agent routing rows with Maria, Hans, Jennifer mapping |
| 4 | FR67-FR68 (Agent departure/bulk reassign) not covered in Nico's Journey 5 | 🔴 Must Fix | ✅ Added agent departure edge case with FR64-FR65 capabilities |
| 5 | FR numbering non-sequential — FR67-FR68 before FR64-FR66 in document order | 🟡 Should Fix | ✅ Renumbered: FR67→FR64, FR68→FR65, FR64→FR67, FR65→FR68, FR66→FR69 |
| 6 | Missing shortlist analytics — no way to track property save popularity | 🟢 Enhancement | ✅ Added FR66: anonymous shortlist analytics event + admin popularity view |

**Post-fix FR count:** 69 FRs (FR1-FR69, fully sequential) + 30 NFRs = 99 total requirements

## Measurability Validation

### Functional Requirements

**Total FRs Analyzed:** 69
**Format Violations:** 0 — All follow "[Actor] can [capability]" or "The system [does]" pattern
**Subjective Adjectives Found:** 0 — All matches were in journey narratives or non-subjective usage
**Vague Quantifiers Found:** 0
**Implementation Leakage:** 0 (analyzed separately in Step 7)

**FR Violations Total:** 0

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Total NFRs Analyzed:** 30
**Missing Metrics:** 0
**Incomplete Template:** 0
**Missing Context:** 0

**NFR Violations Total:** 0

### Overall Assessment

**Total Requirements:** 99
**Total Violations:** 0
**Severity:** ✅ Pass

---

## Traceability Validation

### Chain Validation

**Executive Summary → Success Criteria:** ✅ Intact
**Success Criteria → User Journeys:** ✅ Intact — All 11 criteria supported by journeys
**User Journeys → Functional Requirements:** ✅ Intact — Journey Requirements Summary table maps 24+ capabilities to journeys
**Scope → FR Alignment:** ✅ Intact — All 12 MVP scope bullets have corresponding FRs

### Orphan Elements

**Orphan Functional Requirements:** 0
**Unsupported Success Criteria:** 0
**User Journeys Without FRs:** 0

**Total Traceability Issues:** 0
**Severity:** ✅ Pass

---

## Implementation Leakage Validation

### Leakage by Category

**Frontend Frameworks:** 0 violations (Next.js references in Implementation Stack only, not in FRs)
**Backend Frameworks:** 0 violations
**Databases:** 0 violations in FRs (Supabase/PostGIS references in journeys and Implementation Stack)
**Cloud Platforms:** 0 violations in FRs (Vercel references in Implementation Stack only)
**Infrastructure:** 0 violations
**Libraries:** 0 violations

**Implementation Details Found in FRs:** 0 violations (resolved)
- ~~Line 508 — FR20: "Mapbox static" → fixed to "static map image"~~ ✅
- ~~Line 559 — FR50: "PostGIS" → removed~~ ✅

**Borderline:** FR22 "localStorage" — serves as behavioral specification for anonymous persistence (acceptable)

### Summary

**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** 0 (2 resolved)
**Severity:** ✅ Pass

**Recommendation:** All implementation leakage resolved. FR20 and FR50 now use technology-agnostic capability descriptions.

---

## Domain Compliance Validation

**Domain:** Real Estate
**Complexity:** Low (standard)
**Assessment:** N/A — No special domain compliance requirements

**Note:** PRD exceeds expectations with a dedicated Domain-Specific Requirements section covering maritime zone law, property ownership types, currency, translation glossary, and investment context.

---

## Project-Type Compliance Validation

**Project Type:** web_app

### Required Sections

| Required Section | Status |
|---|---|
| User Journeys | ✅ Present (8 journeys) |
| UX/UI Requirements | ✅ Present |
| Responsive Design | ✅ Present (NFR4, NFR14, NFR16-20) |

### Excluded Sections

None typically excluded for web_app.

**Required Sections:** 3/3 present
**Excluded Violations:** 0
**Compliance Score:** 100%
**Severity:** ✅ Pass

---

## SMART Requirements Validation

**Total Functional Requirements:** 69

**All scores ≥ 3:** 100% (69/69)
**All scores ≥ 4:** 100% (69/69)
**Overall Average Score:** 4.9/5.0
**Flagged FRs (score < 3):** 0

**Severity:** ✅ Pass

**Recommendation:** FRs demonstrate excellent SMART quality. FR67-69 (Static Content) scored slightly lower on Specificity/Measurability due to brief descriptions, but all scores remain ≥ 4.

---

## Holistic Quality Assessment

### Document Flow & Coherence

**Assessment:** Excellent

**Strengths:**
- Seamless narrative arc from vision → journeys → requirements → phasing
- 8 user journeys as compelling stories (not dry requirements)
- Explicit "Capability Contract" makes document self-enforcing
- Journey Requirements Summary table bridges narrative and specs
- Failure scenarios add depth without bloating

### Dual Audience Effectiveness

**For Humans:** Executive-friendly, developer-clear, designer-ready, stakeholder-actionable
**For LLMs:** Machine-readable (YAML frontmatter, numbered FRs), UX-ready, architecture-ready, epic/story-ready

**Dual Audience Score:** 5/5

### BMAD PRD Principles Compliance
